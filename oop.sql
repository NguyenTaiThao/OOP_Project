And through training thousands of Southeast Asians , I have discovered a very surprising truth . ,, I have discovered that how well somebody communicates in English actually has very little to do with their English level . It has a lot to do with their attitude towards English . ,, There are people out there who have a very low level of English , and they can communicate very very well . One of them that I remember was a student , a participant of mine , named Faizal . He was a factory supervisor - English level very very low but this guy ,, could just sit and listen to anybody , very calmly , clearly , and then he could respond , absolutely express his thoughts beautifully , at a very low level of English . So , today I want to share with you : ,, what is so different about people like Faizal ? How do they do it ? And second of all , why is this so important not only to you , but to your children , to your community , and to the future of Malaysia ? ,, And third of all , what’s one thing you can do , starting today , if you want to speak with that calm , clear confidence that people like Faizal have . First of all , what is so different ? How do people like Faizal do it ? ,, To answer that question , I’m going to take you back about 10 years , okay ? I was training staff at that time , and my daughter , at that time , was taking piano lessons . And I started to notice two really strong similarities ,, between my daughter’s attitude or thinking towards playing the piano and a lot of Malaysians’ thinking or attitude towards English . First of all , I should tell you my daughter ,, absolutely hated piano , hated the lessons , hated practicing . This is my daughter practicing piano , okay ?
